**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Professional & Enterprise-Grade** - Conveys technical sophistication and strategic thinking appropriate for executive and technical stakeholders
2. **Informative & Educational** - Clearly communicates complex architectural concepts through visual hierarchy and progressive disclosure
3. **Modern & Forward-Thinking** - Reflects innovation and transformation through contemporary design patterns that suggest cloud-native maturity

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- This is an interactive demonstration platform that presents architecture diagrams, AI agent capabilities, migration strategies, and key metrics in an engaging, explorable format without requiring backend services or complex state management.

- **Trigger**: User n

### Migration Strategy Timelin
- **Functionality**: Interactive diagram showing all system layers (User Channels, Gateway & API, Microservices, AI Agents, Data Platform, Security & Identity, DevOps & Observability)
- **Purpose**: Provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the modernized platform architecture
- **Trigger**: User lands on the main dashboard
- **Functionality**: Key performance indicators showing the platform's current challenges and expected outcomes post-modernization
- **Trigger**: User views metrics section or dashboard overview

## Edge Case Handling
